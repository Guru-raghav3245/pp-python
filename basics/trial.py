# Given a series of numbers in a sequence from a starting number to end number
# Only one number in the sequence is missing
# Find the missing number

# TIP - This is a Math problem, so solve it first
# You should be able to summarize the approach you are making
# Run some tests manually on paper to ensure that your logic works

# The Coding part will be easy once you can figure out the math
my_sequence = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 2]
